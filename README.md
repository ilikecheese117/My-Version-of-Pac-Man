For Phase 1 we created an original Map#4, added random ghosts by pressing g and fixed the number
of lives that pacman can have to 3

For Phase 2 we implemented the abstract Powerup class and a DoubleSpeed Powerup that activates
when you press the spacebar. We also made it possible to pause the game by pressing p and
win when you eat all the entities(fruits and dots)

Finally, for Phase 3 we implemented the Cherry, Strawberry and Random Powerups. The Cherry
teleports you to a random location, Strawberry makes you invicible and invincible to ghosts
and Random summons random fruits every 100 entities eaten. They give you rarndom points 
between 100 and 900. A ChoosePlayerState was also added which let's you change between Pacman and
and Ms. Pacman. The character select menu is accesible in the main menu.
